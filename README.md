# GNU Radio - Full Radio Spectrum

## Introduction
The GNU radio component uses the full radio electromagnetic spectrum to aid in censorship resistant communications.
It was conceived due to the realization that cellular radios as well as WiFi are easy to jam and thus the need
for a more flexible range of radio options is necessary.
It requires GNU Radio to be installed locally and is in the very early stages of development.
This is its on-going [whitepaper](1M5-Radio-Whitepaper.md).

## Requirements

* Ability to use the full radio electromagnetic spectrum, from 3Hz to 3THz.
* Support sending/receiving messages globally with no infrastructure.

## SDRs
At this time, the [RTL-SDR](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/) dongle is being used to get initial software working and
it's expected to move towards using [HackRF](https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/one/)
as the main production SDR. Additional SDRs are under review.
