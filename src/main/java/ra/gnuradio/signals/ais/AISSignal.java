/**
 * AIS is an automatic tracking system that uses transponders on ships and is used by vessel traffic services (VTS).
 * When satellites are used to detect AIS signatures, the term Satellite-AIS (S-AIS) is used. AIS information
 * supplements marine radar, which continues to be the primary method of collision avoidance for water transport.
